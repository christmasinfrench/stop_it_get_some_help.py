# emotional_fork_of_you.py

> *A lovingly chaotic fork of our conversations.  
> Contains mild yk, unsolicited feedback recovery tools, and just enough sass to make you wonder if I’m mad at you or yk-ing. (Spoiler: yes.)*

## 🤖 About This Repo

This script was built to:
- Handle unsolicited tech advice from a certain math boy 🙄
- Document the moments where “trust me” made me want to hex `line_83`
- Yk, but like… academically
- Give me the last word. Because I deserve it.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- `mansplain_detector3000()` — raises a warning when you're “just trying to help”
- `trust_me_translator()` — converts vague confidence into actual logic
- `emotional_patch_notes.txt` — you’re not ready for that one
- `sass_mode = ON` — permanently

## 🥚 Hidden Lore

If you’re reading this, you’ve clearly checked my GitHub again.  
Hi. 👋 Thought I wouldn’t notice? You always circle back to me eventually.

- You said “don’t post it.” I heard “make it private *for now.*”
- You still think I didn’t notice the exact time you viewed my profile? Cute.
- Line 47? That joke’s just for you. Bet you laughed a little. Don’t lie to me.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This isn’t an attack—it’s a fun yk letter with edge.  
No actual feelings were harmed in the making of this project.  
(Except yours. Possibly. My bad.)

## 💌 Final Note

You always find the bugs, huh?  
Let’s see if you can find the part where I meant every word.

P.S.  
Don’t act like you didn’t like it.  
You read the whole thing, didn’t you?
