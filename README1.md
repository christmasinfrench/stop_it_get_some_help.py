# stop_it_get_some_help.py

## Overview

This script gently reminds helpful-but-overbearing tech bros to SIT DOWN and STOP unsolicited code reviews on things they were never invited to touch. Especially when they find your public repo faster than your own compiler and start line-checking your logic like it's a Google interview.

## Features

- Automatic Detection of:
  - Unasked-for GitHub critiques
  - Unsolicited "get rid of line 83 & 84" advice
  - Compliment sandwiches made entirely of passive-aggression

- Outputs:
  - "Thanks, but I didn't ask you to clone my confidence."
  - "I'm not your intern. Please refrain from live-debugging my emotions."
  - "The only thing I needed from you was a 'cool!' and a high-five emoji."

## Installation

No install necessary. Just open your mouth a little less and your ears a little more.

## Usage

```python
if unsolicited_feedback == True:
    print("STOP IT. GET SOME HELP.")
    exit()
