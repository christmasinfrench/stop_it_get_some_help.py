# stop_it_get_some_help.py
A script for overly enthusiastic guy friends who mistake GitHub for a feedback hotline. Meant for those who can't resist correcting things you never asked them to look at. Not optimized for humility.
For example:
“Lines 83 and 84 need to go, but nice formatting tho 😘” — like sir?? Is this a tech critique or are you negging my repo?? PICK ONE.
It’s giving:
🧠 “I’m the main character of your GitHub.”
📉 “Your work is my homework now.”
💁‍♂️ “I didn’t ask if you wanted feedback because I already decided you did.”
